<br>...Through the use of redundancy and storing keys (or access numbers of the records) that satisfy different combinations of <b>secondary</b> <b>index</b> values in "buckets," it is possible to retrieve all keys satisfying any input query derived from a subset of fields by a single access to an <b>index</b> file, although each bucket may be used for many combinations of values and a combination of buckets may be required for a given query ...The method which, in its degenerate case, becomes the conventional <b>secondary</b> <b>index</b> filing scheme works similarly but has the following advantages: (1) the elimination of multiple accesses in many cases; (2) the elimination of false drops; (3) the elimination of computer time to <b>perform</b> intersection of key sets each qualified for one <b>secondary</b> <b>index</b> field only; and (4) the avoidance of long strings of keys when an <b>index</b> field appearing in a query has very few possible values
